### Session 6
This session is to practice cross validation for fitting statistical models, such as simple and multiple regression models using various types of data

- K-fold cross-validation
- Repeated cross-validation
- The whole process of model assessment for its prediction (apparent validation, internal validation, external validation)
- Non-random split

### Session 7
This session is about regularising regression models such as Ridge and LASSO model using `glmnet` package.
- Ridge
- LASSO
