## Lecture examples ######

## First, we'll create a fake dataset of 30 individuals of different ages:
#set seed to ensure reproducible results
set.seed(123)       # remove seed to get different simulations  
age=rnorm(30,70,7)  # generates 30 values, with mean of 70 (years) and s.d.=7
age=sort(age)       # sorts these values in ascending order. 
ad=c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1) # assign 'developed althzheimer' to these 30 in a non-random way.

# saves dataframe with two columns: age & developed Altzheimer
dat=as.data.frame(cbind(age, ad))
dat # shows you what your dataset looks like.

# Plot the data
# Plot with age on x-axis and developed Altzheimer (0 or 1) on y-axis
plot(age,ad,xlab="Age",ylab="Developed Altzheimer", ) 

# Logistic regression model (in this case, generalized linear model 
# with logit link). see ?glm
 mylogit=glm(ad~age,family=binomial,data = dat) 
 summary(mylogit)
# CIs using standard errors
 confint.default(mylogit)
# Odds ratios and 95% CI
# exponentiate the coefficient means the odds ratio in logistic regression
 exp(coef(mylogit)) 
 exp(confint(mylogit))
# Nicer output
 exp(cbind(OR = coef(mylogit), confint(mylogit)))
 
# Plot the predicted probability of developing Altzhemier 
# Plot with age on x-axis and developed Altzheimer (0 or 1) on y-axis
 plot(age,ad,xlab="Age",ylab="Probability of developing Altzheimer") 
# Add a prediction curve based on your logistic regression model to your plot
# "curve" draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
 curve(predict(mylogit,data.frame(age=x),type="resp"),add=TRUE)
# optional: this draws an the predicted probabilities for each case 
# based on a fit "mylogit" to glm model. pch= changes type of dots.
 points(age,fitted(mylogit),pch=20)
 
 ## If you have many data a histogram shows you the distribution of events better
 library(popbio)
 logi.hist.plot(age,ad,boxp=FALSE,type="hist",col="gray") # each box of the two histogramms represents the number of cases within a 5 year period

##### Predcitng at risk of autism ########

# Group 1 = high risk group Group 0 = control group
 summary(autism)

# Descriptive statistics for each variable by group
# Group 1 = high risk group Group 0 = control group
 describeBy(autism,autism$group)

# Important: glmnet needs the predictor and outcome variables in separate data files
# x needs to be in matrix format and y needs to be defined as a factor (=categorical) variable!
# autism[ ,-1] means that all columns except the first one (group) will be  copied into x
 x<-as.matrix(autism[,-1])
# autism[ ,1] means that only that first column will be copied into y
# as.factor()  change the group variable into a factor variable. This will be saved in the vecotr y
 y<-as.factor(autism[,1])  # 1 = high risk 0 = control

# Regularized logistic regression (family = binomial calls logistic regression)
# Note alpha = 1 for lasso only (penalty down to alpha=0 ridge only)
# We fit the model and store the results in the object "glmmod"
# glmmod contains all information of the fitted model 
 glmmod<-glmnet(x,y,alpha=1,family='binomial')

# Visualize the coefficients by executing the plot function:
# Each curve corresponds to a variable: 
# The curve shows the path of its coefficient against log of lambda of the whole coefficient vector at as
# The axis on the top shows the number of nonzero coefficients at the current
# The y axis shows the regression coefficients of a variable at current 
 plot(glmmod, "lambda" )
# If we use the print function we will get a summary of glmnet at each step of ??
# including the number of included variables (Df) and the % explained DEviance (%Dev) 
 print(glmmod) 

# Select best lambda using 10-fold cross-validation based on sum of deviance residuals ####
# If we want  AUC as selection criteria we need to include <<"type.measure = "auc">>
# AUC needs larger smaple sizes that 36 
 set.seed(123) # remove if you want to get a different random sample of CV
 cv.glmmod<- cv.glmnet(x,y,family='binomial')
# Plot the object. It shows the cross-validation curve (and upper and lower standard devitaion) along the ?? sequence 
# On the y-axis is a measure of the model goodness (here: Binomial deviance: the samller the deviance the better the model)
# The two horizontal lines shows the lambda of minimum deviance and the lambda 1 SE larger than the minimal lambda (more regularized than minimum lambda)
  plot(cv.glmmod, xvar="lambda")
# To view the two lambdas type:

# Save the minimum and 1se below minimum lambda 
 best_lambda <- cv.glmmod$lambda.min

# using minimum lambda + 1SE:
#    y_prob<-predict(cv.glmmod,type="response",newx=x, s = "lambda.1se")
  
  
  # Or we can predict to which class a case belongs (high risk or control) 
# The default threshold for interpreting probabilities to class labels is 0.5,
  y_pred<-as.numeric(predict(cv.glmmod,type="class",newx=x, s = "lambda.min"))  # comment roc command needs predction to be numberic

# Sensitivity: 0.9474

# AUC is a measure of discrimination (equivalent to the Concordance or C statistics)
# One way of interpreting AUC is as the probability that the model ranks a random positive example
# more highly than a random negative example.
# High risk is coded as 1 and low risk as 0

# Important : These measures of prediction accuracy are over-optimistic because they are 
# they are estimated from the same data set we used for model selection. 
# These validity measures are called apparent validity!  
# To obtain internal validity, we need to hold out a sample before we select (using CV) and fit the model

### # Repeated cross-validation ###### 
 
#  Optional: Repeating n-fold cross-validatoin usig loop ###### 
#  Selecting lambda based on a single run of 10-fold cross-validation is usually
#  not recommended. The procedure should be repeated 100 times (with different folds)
#  and the mean of each 100 minimum lambdas (or 100 minimum +1 SE lambdas) should be used 
#  This can be easily done with a loop or we use the caret package and its function "trainControl" and train ####
#  The package allows allows to use parallel computing: Large portions of code can run concurrently in different cores 
# and reduces the total time for the computation. To use parallel computong we need to load the package "doParalell"
